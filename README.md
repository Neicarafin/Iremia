My first ever coding project! A clean and simple notes application for organizing thoughts, ideas, and daily entries.
Features:

Create, edit, and delete notes with rich text formatting
Organize notes with color-coding (yellow, pink, blue)
Add images to your notes
Archive and trash system for note management
Search functionality to quickly find entries
Local storage - all data saved in your browser

Built with: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This was a learning experience in building a functional web app from scratch, working with DOM manipulation, local storage, and creating an intuitive user interface.
